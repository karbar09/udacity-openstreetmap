Area: Shanghai, China
A subarea of china, this region extends into the pacific ocean and includes 12 major districts as well public transportation info.

Why?

I am currently living in China. I am not fluent in mandarin, but I can recognize some basic characters (such as street types), and thought it would be interesting to see what kind of inconsistencies and localization problems might arrise in this data.
